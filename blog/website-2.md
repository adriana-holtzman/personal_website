# how i built this website #2

some things i have changed since i last blogged about how i built this website:

1. i changed the font (i started hating the other one, this one seems way more neutral to me). i am not sure where this font originally came from, i got it from a folder of unused fonts from my professional website. 

2. i was annoyed that the menu on the left was so wide / unable to be sized down without making the home button much smaller, and the fabric and lace background made it too hard to see things, so i was deterred from adding more content within the left hand column space. so, i moved the menu bar to the top. it still needs some work, because on mobile or any other small-ish device half of the menu options are entirely gone. i think the large text looks good even though it is not very functional.  

3. i made everything more round. there is now a left column, a central content area, and a right column which are all rounded. this setup will also make it easier to build a mobile friendly setup in the future. everything has a bounding box, which is to me more organized. 

4. i added album cover and a clock, so the "now" content is more visual. mostly for fun! i think the album covers look great, not sure how long the clock will last though. i also made the currently playing song update every 10 seconds instead of waiting for reload, since it is always on the screen.

5. i added a photo gallery to the media consumption page. i had this vision of creating a pinterest style wall of art that i have liked. i am not sure if i like it or how to reconcile it with the rest of the media consumption page... all i know is that i think i may be putting everything into a json file in the future. it is so messy to organize. i think whether it is in a table format or is more gallery/image based, i still need some kind of json file to organize relationships between categories, photos, and descriptions. the main issue i think is that i am not sure of the point of this page. maybe it will be a notion style database of media i like with different view options? what is the point!

6. i created a to do list and update log in the right column. i feel like everyone's personal websites have update logs like this. mine is pretty simple. i also moved the websites that i am crediting to the right column as links using the css that previously was for the buttons to go between blog, consumed, and created pages. 

7. more broadly, i determined that there is no need for this website to have random info like places and goals. i think just a blog of my thoughts, a cute home page, and then some creative ventures is all that this website should include. 

here is what the website looks like now on browser windows of varying widths:

these screenshots are so pretty! it is capturing the arc browser shadows for some reason! :)
