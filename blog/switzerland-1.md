# hi from the sbb

I am writing this on the train (the SBB) from the airport in Zurich towards the airport in Geneva (except I'm getting off in Lausanne). The train is very nice and I am currently taking up two seats. My two giant suitcases are taking up all of the floor space and I am sitting in a ball with my backpack and jacket on top of the seats.

The airplane was quite nice! Not very much legroom but lots of snacks. For dinner, they served chicken and polenta, almonds, a brownie, some vegetables, a roll, and a slice of cheese. I had wine with dinner in hopes of becoming more sleepy but I don't think it worked. Then we got more rolls and yogurt for breakfast. With breakfast I drank tea. Then they brought everyone warm wet towels (to wash your hands? I am not sure of the reason) and chocolate bars with the SWISS Air logo in them. They also had a feature even more fun than the live map: live videos from five vantage points on the plane. When we landed, I watched as if I were sitting on top of the plane! Very exciting for me.

The Swiss landscape so far appears in a way that I associate with France, except with Alps behind it. There are a lot of those tall skinny trees that I feel like Van Gogh liked to paint in France. The sky is quite gray. From the airplane we could see briefly the Alps sticking out through the clouds. That was very pretty! Of course, as I am on a train, most of the foreground consists of train tracks and industrial buildings, which is not too exciting.

At the moment I don't have any wifi or data. I have read that I should just get a tourist eSIM until I have a residence permit, because that will give me some discounts. I tried to set this up on the plane but their wifi wasn't working well enough. I am worried that I will lose my streak on Duolingo!

I took the little blanket they give on the plane so now, assuming I have no bedding provided in my housing arrangement, I have a small blanket that is probably clean. 

I am already concerned how I can possibly return home with the any more suitcases than I currently have. It is very hard to ride an escalator with two large suitcases alone... I have already had a suitcase fall down the escalator :(

Now we are approaching Bern. The only thing I know about Bern is they have bears. I am seeing some very cute buildings on a hillside. 

Fribourg is very cute. Many old buildings and I saw some goats as well. I am seeing some snowcapped mountains!

[Edit: Jan 27 2026] 

After this point, I stopped writing on the train because I was falling asleep and trying to make sure my computer would be put away before my stop. As the train moved towards Lausanne, the view of the city was so beautiful. I could not get a good picture because I was on the other side of the train, but the city is full of buildings built into the hillside, which slopes down towards Lake Geneva. The lake is sparkling and vast. Above the lake, the mountains look giant. They are snowcapped and visible nearly everywhere in Lausanne. I got off the train at the Renens stop (just outside Lausanne), met my friend Lara, and took the 25 bus to my flat.

I am very excited to be in Lausanne! More updates to come...
