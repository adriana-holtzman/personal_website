# how i made this website #1

**inspiration**: i wanted to make a blog so that i can share images and semi-publicly store memories
to reduce my interest in using instagram while studying abroad and beyond. i have been wanted to make 
a personal website for a while (since building my professional website about a year ago) to use and to 
learn more web dev skills, but i didn't feel like i would actually use a blog or internet space until 
now.

## how this website came about

1. i built a basic menu and pages using html/css and asked chatgpt a lot of questions 
about how to build features using js (since my previous website is completely static)

2. i decorated. 
i created a logo (my name) with the blur feature from [type-tools](https://www.type-tools.com/).
this website uses free font absans from [collletttivo](https://www.collletttivo.it/typefaces/absans).
images are from pinterest, google, or my camera roll. 
my favorite was making my custom mouse-chasing-cheese cursor.

3. i filled in the static pages (ongoing) to figure out what else to add, how to make them 
more interactive for users and for my entertainment

4. i built a blog using just js and a json file. this worked but would make me hate having a blog 
because there is no good way to organize the content of a longer blog post within a json file. 
now, i am using markdown instead. i love markdown. it has made me want to write this post!

## how the website looks right now

on my mac, the website looks like this:

here is a video of the mouse following with no cursor on mobile (except the blog looks different now):

  <source src="img/website-1-mobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## to do

1. most of the pages (particularly goals, places) are pretty empty. i'm not sure if i will 
restructure these? or add a more interactive element?

2. for mobile: i did not make an effort to make the website responsive, but it is surprisingly 
usable on mobile. i need to decide if this is worth maintaining.

3. blog comments could be cool, or a guestbook

4. menu bar is pretty empty, not sure what to add

5. i want to add my calico critters to my inventory

overall, i am satisfied with how the website looks so far!
