Notes about EPFL, Lausanne, my housing arrangement:

- My room is pretty big, well insulated, not facing the construction on the other side of my building, and has a view of the mountains, so I am very happy
- The kitchen and bathrooms are pretty nice and sizable as well, however five people is a lot so I think they are appropriately sized
- The EPFL campus has a very interesting style, architecturally, with diverse buildings that are mostly grey and many paved, concrete, grey walking paths. There are many architectural details that I appreciate more up close than I did in pictures of EPFL previously. There is less grass than I am used to for a campus and I still don't understand the layout. Most American campuses are more obviously centralized around a lawn, but EPFL doesn't have any one courtyard to use as a reference point. 
- I have only gone into downtown Lausanne once, and it was a failed venture to a restaurant that was actually closed. I want to go back during daylight hours and see the view of the lake and mountains, as I saw it on the train coming into Lausanne. 

Some challenges:

- So much French, I feel like the EPFL students are unapproachable because they all speak French all the time and wear leather jackets and messenger bags instead of backpacks
- In my French intensive section, I am the only student in my bachelors, the rest are almost all doctoral students, so they are not particularly looking to make friends as I thought the intensive students would be
- At EPFL, everyone can speak English, but when shopping, this is not always true
- I am generally a bit overwhelmed from being here, especially after a very slow winter break, so it is hard for me to do new things all day without feeling very tired. Particularly, eating out is very expensive, ordering in French is stressful, and the grocery store is not far but a more complicated venture without my phone working.

My Swiss IKEA Experience:

When I first arrived at the IKEA, I entered through the wrong door such that I was immediately faced with what appeared to be the IKEA restaurant. I was very hungry and excited to eat the relatively cheap IKEA food before shopping for a pillow and sheets. When I tried to order at the restaurant, I found that they only sold hot dogs!? This was very peculiar and disappointing. I got a hot dog (which was bad, it did not taste like a hot dog) and fries (they were fantastic delicious fries). Then I shopped but in the warehouse section, as I had entered through the wrong door. At this point, I was very disappointed in Swiss IKEA. But then, I asked where the rest of the pillows were and I was directed to the rest of the store, which was upstairs. It was exactly like American IKEA, except there was one room setup that was a wine room with a table that had a lot of plastic cheese on it, which seemed a bit extra Swiss. Then I encountered the main IKEA restaurant, which of course sold Swedish meatballs, mashed potatoes, peas, and everything else that it usually sells. Almost all of the IKEA products in the whole store were products that I had seen before at American IKEA, sometimes with a different type of electrical connection. Overall, a good IKEA, but also nothing groundbreaking. I bought sheets, a duvet cover, a pillow, a hand towel, green tea, and orange elderberry jam. Also, they did not accept my American IKEA family account.
