# A personal curriculum for winter break

I keep seeing online that people are developing their own personal curriculums to structure their 
goals going into the new year. I like this idea! So here is a draft of my 2026 personal curriculum. 

My primary goals for 2026: be healthy, meet new friends, study new topics, and hike in the alps!

### Academics

During winter break, I will begin studying analog IC design, C++, and continue studying French. 

- In addition to Duolingo, I want to take grammar notes because Duolingo does not drill gender and 
conjugation very well in my opinion. 
- I would like to own the analog CMOS textbook by Razavi, and I will read it and take notes throughout 
winter break and whenever I am bored in my first few weeks in Switzerland. 
- To learn C++, I think my best course of action is to just build something with it, but I might read 
a textbook first to understand the classes etc. that differentiate it from C.

### Health

I want hiking boots. I think I will get Merrells designed as trail shoes, although I have not done enough 
research on the topic. I tragically left my running shoes in Pittsburgh so I am left with Adidas Sambas 
as my only sneaker. 

Over winter break, my contributions to the goal of health will be
- cooking and eating more
- planning hikes and other outdoor trips to take this Spring
- get hiking boots and other necessary equipment
- fix my ear piercing which has been angry for months 

### Meeting new friends

I am not too worried about doing this during winter break! I already know everyone here...
