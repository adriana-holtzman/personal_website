# blog post #1

Hello! This is a blog post. It is winter break and I am making this website. 
My goals for the break are to prepare for the spring semester (travel plans, 
academics) and to rest. Currently it is 8:50pm and I am hungry. These days I 
spend a lot of time on Duolingo learning French. Bye bye!
