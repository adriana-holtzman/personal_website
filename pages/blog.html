    <h3>Tue, Dec 23, 2025 - blog post #1</h3>
    <p>Hello! This is a blog post. It is winter break and I am making 
        this website. My goals for the break are to prepare for the 
        spring semester (travel plans, academics) and to rest. Currently 
        it is 8:50pm and I am hungry. These days I spend a lot of time 
        on Duolingo learning French. Bye bye!
