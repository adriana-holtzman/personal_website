    <p>hello! this is a blog post. it is winter break and I am making 
        this website. my goals for the break are to prepare for the 
        spring semester (travel plans, academics) and to rest. currently 
        it is 8:50pm and I am hungry. these days I spend a lot of time 
        on Duolingo learning French. bye bye!
