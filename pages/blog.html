<p>Welcome to my blog! I am planning to use this blog to write about my travels and 
    experiences while studying abroad and beyond.

    <p>Hello! This is a blog post. It is winter break and I am making 
        this website. My goals for the break are to prepare for the 
        spring semester (travel plans, academics) and to rest. Currently 
        it is 8:50pm and I am hungry. These days I spend a lot of time 
        on Duolingo learning French. Bye bye!
